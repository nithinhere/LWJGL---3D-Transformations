# LWJGL---3D-Transformations

Shape 3D does the transformation with the help of setRotate method.
There are two set Rotate methods in the shape 3d. one is for passing matrix from the class and the other on is for passing angle and rotation from the main class
Box and Pyramid.java contains vertices for the bos and pyramid shapes to be drawn.
COlor buffer is maintained in box and pyramid inorder to set different colours for each faces.
Color points and vertex coordinates are being sent to the GPU with the help fo the setCoorddata and setColordata which inturn
transfers the point to gpu.
